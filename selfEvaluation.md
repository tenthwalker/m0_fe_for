# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
**I feel about 2.5/5 confident, I feel like the logic behind it makes sense to me, but the syntax of how to apply that understanding to produce a line of code is still fairly shaky.**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
**I definitely think I approached it with a lot of confidence and then was pretty frustrated when I hit a wall (rapidly decaying unproductive struggle) and had to take a break. I was able to get help from a small group-mate and then reverse-engineer their logic to frame the content in a way that made the syntax and logic click for me.**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
**I still need to read some of the bonus content links from the other lessons to get overall more fluent in the syntax of JavaScript, because I think that missing vocabulary is what's such a sticking point for creating unproductive struggle.**
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
**I still need to find out some good other sources for reading code examples like some of the lessons we've done, and I can find those by practicing my "asking technical questions" skills on Google.**
